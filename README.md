RoboClone [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/simon-andrews/roboclone.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/simon-andrews/roboclone)
=========
A neat little script for cloning git repositories containing FRC robot projects
and configuring them for use with Eclipse.

Install Instructions
--------------------
Open a terminal and run:
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/simon-andrews/roboclone.git
```

Usage
-----
Now that you have RoboClone installed, it's time to use it! Open a terminal and type `roboclone`. Something like this
should show up:
```
$ roboclone
usage: roboclone [-h] remote_url [destination]
roboclone: error: too few arguments
```

Add the `-h` switch to show a help message:
```
$ roboclone -h
usage: roboclone [-h] remote_url [destination]

positional arguments:
  remote_url   url of the remote git repository (https or ssh)
  destination  directory to clone repository to

optional arguments:
  -h, --help   show this help message and exit
```

Clone a repository:
```
$ roboclone https://github.com/Team4761/2015-Robot-Code.git
